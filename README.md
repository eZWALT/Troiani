## Why Troiani?
- **Ease of Use**: Designed with simplicity in mind, this programming language combines high-level syntax with low-level capabilities, supporting a wide range of programming paradigms.
- **Performance**: Making use of the LLVM ecosystem, this compiler delivers exceptionally competitive performance and a robust infrastructure.
- **Reliability**: With strong static typing and ownership semantics, this language minimizes potential bugs at compile time, ensuring robust code.

## Install

The Troiani compiler is currently under development and can only be installed from source, following the guide on [INSTALL](./INSTALL.md)

## Usage

Work in progress!
